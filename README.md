# FormDesigner
__A proof of concept UI for designing a payment form.__

The website this was built for uses [Foundation for Sites](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites.html 'Foundation for Sites') as the base for all of the layout and styling. As such, the [app.css](../blob/master/assets/css/app.css 'app.css') and [app.js](../blob/master/assets/css/app.js 'app.js') files are very bloated for the simple needs of this concept. They were included to make sure that any custom coding that was done would not interfer with the base CSS and JS that were already implemented.
