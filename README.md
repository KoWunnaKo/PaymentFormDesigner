# FormDesigner
__A proof of concept UI for designing a payment form.__

As this was built purely as a proof of concept, not all of the functionality was fully flushed out. Once this UI was at its current point, the development team and company stakeholders were able to see what was planned and sign off on implementing the new feature. All further development was done within the web app this was being built for.

Another thing to note is that the [app.css](../blob/master/assets/css/app.css 'app.css') and [app.js](../blob/master/assets/css/app.js 'app.js') files are very bloated for the simple needs of this concept. This is due to the use of [Foundation for Sites](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites.html 'Foundation for Sites') as the base for all of the layout and styling within the web app it was being developed for. The bloated files were included to make sure that any custom coding that was done would not interfer with the base CSS and JS that were already implemented.
