# Payment Form Designer
### A proof of concept UI for designing a payment form.

As this was built purely as a proof of concept, not all of the functionality was fully flushed out. Once this UI was in its current state, the company stakeholders and development team were able to see the proposed direction and sign off on implementing the new feature. All further development was done within the web app this was being built for.

Another item of note is that the [app.css](../blob/master/assets/css/app.css 'app.css') and [app.js](../blob/master/assets/css/app.js 'app.js') files are very bloated for the simple needs of this concept. This is due to the use of [Foundation for Sites](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites.html 'Foundation for Sites') as the base for all of the layout and styling within the parent web app. The framework files were included to make sure that any custom coding would not interfer with the base CSS and JS that were already implemented.
